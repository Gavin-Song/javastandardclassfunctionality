# Java Standard Class Functionality

A simple web app to create a java class that follows java standard class functionality. Helpful for any students in the US who are taking a
computer science course (If you're still using Java when you read this). Very basic, don't expect any fancy well documented code.

This "app" is literally a collection of web pages. Setup should be minimal.

### Prerequisites

```
Modern web browser
Internet connection (To load some fonts and files)
```

### Installing

First, clone the git repo to your desktop.

```

```

Then open it up and run index.html
